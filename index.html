            <h2>‘I will die in there before anything happens’: Why this region of Russia produces so many MMA champions
            </h2>
            <p>Ibragim Ibragimov’s latest victory over Kenny Mokhonoana kept alive his unbeaten start to professional

            <h2>Ilia Topuria ups ante in Islam Makhachev standoff: 'You can't keep avoiding me'</h2>
            <p>Ilia Topuria won't accept anything less than a UFC lightweight title shot for his next fight.

                Topuria (16-0 MMA, 8-0 UFC) has reiterated that he was promised an immediate title shot at 155 pounds by
                the UFC after vacating his featherweight belt. However, lightweight champion Islam Makhachev (27-1 MMA,
                16-1 UFC) and his mentor, Khabib Nurmagomedov, insist that Topuria needs to earn his shot by beating a
                No. 1 contender, with Nurmagomedov also not wanting Makhachev to fight another featherweight.</p>

            <h2>Joe Rogan reveals why Fedor Emelianenko never fought in the UFC</h2>
            <p>Over the years, there have been many rumors as to why the Russian never fought under the UFC banner, with
                him previously stating that one of the reasons is because he felt that Dana White hated him.

                However, UFC commentator Joe Rogan has revealed the reason as to why Fedor never signed with the
                promotion, despite years of talks.

                “So, Fedor was controlled by some Russian people, that were very rough men, as it were, gangster type
                characters,” he began to explain in an episode of his podcast.

                “They had a bunch of negotiations with the UFC, but they were very unreasonable demands. They wanted
                part of the promotion, they wanted to own a piece of everything, they wanted a lot.

                “Because they knew that with Fedor, they had the golden ticket, and they wanted to play it out as much
                as possible. The negotiations were very intense and very confrontational, they got bad, (to the point
                that) Dana had to up his security, it got heavy.</p>

            <h2>Dana White wins $10,000 as ‘Island Boys’ star Kodiyakredd is KO’d in cage fight</h2>
            <p>Ross brought the MMA cage to his Brand Risk Promotions in Miami last night, and managed to get White and
                the rarely-heard-from Hunter Campbell on commentary for a big chunk of the show. The pair bantered with
                Ross and boxing champion Teofimo Lopez on a comical night full of stoppage finishes.</p>
